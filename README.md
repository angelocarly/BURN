# BURN
![build](https://github.com/angelocarly/BURN/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)  
Generative art Vulkan engine. 


## What is it?
A potential improvement of [Burst](https://github.com/angelocarly/burst).

What I learned from developing Burst:
- Managing many git submodules is hell.
- Vulkan-hpp and VMA-hpp aren't as useful as I thought.
- I actually would like swapchain resizing.
- I didn't experience much extra usefulness from the layer above Vulkan.
- Presenter framework was nice, but unnecessary. Splitting into modules is nice though.
